# Hostname Changer

Added this as someone requested it. This will change the hostname every (X) seconds as defined at the top of the file.

This is mostly for servers that want it to always be fresh and to try and attract more players.

You can turn this off by doing `UseHexane.HostnameToggle = false` in the config.
